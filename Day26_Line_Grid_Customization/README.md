# Day 26 â€“ Matplotlib Line and Grid Customizations

On Day 26 of my Data Science journey, I explored advanced Matplotlib customizations including line styles and grid configurations.

##  Key Concepts:
- Line customizations: `linestyle`, `linewidth`, `color`
- Gridlines: `plt.grid()`, customizing grid appearance
- Enhanced readability in plots

##  What I Practiced:
- Solid, dashed, dotted, and dash-dot lines
- Light/dark gridlines with transparency
- Combined customization for professional-looking plots

##  Files:
- `Day26_Line_Grid_Customization.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook
- `Day26_Line_Grid_Customization.html`: HTML version (for GitHub preview)

##  Summary:
Today's session helped me understand how small visual tweaks make plots more readable and aesthetically pleasing. These skills are essential for storytelling with data.
