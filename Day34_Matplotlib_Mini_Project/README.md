#  Day 34: Matplotlib Mini Project – Sales Data Visualization

##  Overview
This mini project applies everything learned in Matplotlib by visualizing a **sample sales dataset**.  
We explore sales of three products (A, B, C) across six months and compare them with profit margins.

##  Key Plots
- Grouped Bar Chart → Monthly sales comparison  
- Stacked Bar Chart → Total sales across products  
- Line Chart → Sales + Profit margin trend  
- Pie Chart → Contribution of each product to total sales  
- Scatter Plot → Relationship between average sales and profit margin  

##  Skills Learned
- Applying Matplotlib in a **realistic scenario**
- Using multiple chart types for storytelling
- Customizing visuals with labels, annotations, legends, and colors
