#  Day 23: Pie Charts in Matplotlib

On Day 23 of my data science journey, I explored how to create and customize pie charts using Matplotlib.

##  What I Learned
- How to visualize part-to-whole relationships with `plt.pie()`
- Customizing pie charts using:
  - `labels`, `colors`, `explode`, `autopct`, `shadow`, `startangle`
  - `plt.axis('equal')` to keep the pie circular
- Highlighting slices to draw attention
- Styling and readability tips

##  Example Output
A pie chart showing programming language popularity, with Python highlighted and percentage labels shown.

##  Files Included
- `Day23_Pie_Charts.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete code and explanations
- `Day23_Pie_Charts.html` – HTML export for easy viewing
