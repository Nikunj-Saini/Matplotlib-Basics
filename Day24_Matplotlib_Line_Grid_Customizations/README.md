# ðŸ“ŠDay 24: Advanced Line and Grid Customization in Matplotlib

Today, I focused on making line plots more visually informative by customizing:

- Line color, style (`--`, `:`, `-.`), and width
- Data point markers (`'o'`, `'s'`, `'^'`)
- Grid visibility and design (major/minor, dashed/dotted, color)

 Files:
- `Day24_Matplotlib_Line_Grid_Customizations.ipynb` â€“ Full notebook with explanations
- `Day24_Matplotlib_Line_Grid_Customizations.html` â€“ Static HTML version for preview
- 
   Highlights:
- Used `plt.plot()` with advanced parameters
- Customized `plt.grid()` for better readability

Small changes like these make visualizations easier to understand and more professional.
